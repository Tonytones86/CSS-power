        <h2>Why CSS is Important</h2>
        <p>CSS is essential for web development because it separates content from presentation. This separation allows for greater flexibility and control over the design of web pages. With CSS, you can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.</p>
        <p>Additionally, CSS enables you to apply styles to multiple elements simultaneously, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website.</p>

                Understanding how to use these selectors effectively is crucial for applying styles to specific elements on a web page.</p>
